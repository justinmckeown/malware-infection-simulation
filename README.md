# malware-infection-simulation
Linux commandline script: This code was written to simulate the infection behaviour of a piece of hypothetical malware. The malware is spread willfully by paid mules who infect secondary users. The purpose of this script is to work out roughly how long it will take for infection to reach appropriate density of spread among owners of targeted systems. The code is structured to reflect this. As part of this the script attempts to utilise what is popularly known as 'Dunbars number' (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004724849290081J?via%3Dihub) to limit the pools of people available to each infected device.
